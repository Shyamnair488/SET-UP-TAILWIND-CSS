# Tailwind CSS Setup Guide for Your Project

This guide will help you set up a project with Tailwind CSS for building your website. Follow these steps to get started.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

---

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Install Node.js

If Node.js isn't already installed, install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

---

### 2. Create Project Directory Structure

Set up your project folder as follows:

```plaintext
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ src/

---

### 3. Install Tailwind CSS

In the terminal (VS Code or any terminal you use), run the following commands to install Tailwind CSS and initialize it:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init

This will install Tailwind CSS and generate a tailwind.config.js file in your project.

---

4. Create input.css File
Create a new file called input.css inside the src/ folder. Add the following lines to input.css:

css
Copy code
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
If you encounter any errors, press Ctrl + , (comma) in VS Code, search for "unknown", and choose to ignore the error.

5. Install VS Code Extensions
To enhance your development experience, install the following VS Code extensions:

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
Tailwind CSS IntelliSense with Hex Colors
6. Link Tailwind CSS in index.html
In your dist/index.html file, add the following script tag inside the <head> section:

html
Copy code
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
7. Update tailwind.config.js
Now, open the tailwind.config.js file and update it with the following configuration:

javascript
Copy code
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./dist/index.html"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
8. Generate the Tailwind CSS File
Run the following command in the terminal to generate the compiled CSS file:

bash
Copy code
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css
This will compile the Tailwind CSS into a style.css file in the dist/ folder.

9. Watch for Real-Time Updates
To automatically update your style.css file whenever you make changes to input.css, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch
This will watch for changes and recompile the CSS in real-time.

10. Update tailwind.config.js for Multiple HTML Files
If you have multiple HTML files in the dist/ folder, update the content section in your tailwind.config.js file to:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  content: ["./dist/*.html"],  // Update for multiple HTML files
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
Additional Resources
For more detailed information, refer to the official Tailwind CSS Documentation.
Next Steps
You can now start building your website by adding Tailwind CSS classes to your HTML files.

Make sure to keep the npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch command running in your terminal to automatically update the CSS.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
