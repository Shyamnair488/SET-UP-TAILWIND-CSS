install extensions like Tailwind CSS IntelliSense,Tailwind CSS IntelliSense with Hex Colors in vs code 

now go to your html page and andd the script in head "   <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>"  in it

now for direct update 

then go to ur tailwind.config.js file and update the data to /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
                                                            module.exports = {
                                                            content: ["./dist/index.html"],
                                                            theme: {
                                                                extend: {},
                                                            },
                                                            plugins: [],
                                                            }


then in cmd  write a code npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css     // input and output foleder to be mentioned correctly
this will add the real time data into ur css file and link it with ur html file which is required only to 

now i have to run it many time to do so  we use npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/style.css --watch

now update ur code of in to 
                    module.exports = {
                        content: ["./dist/*.html"],                      //Changes
                        theme: {
                            extend: {},
                        },
                        plugins: [],
                        }


now if u can work on it and start building ur website using this 
if u dont remember any commands then  u can use the link of tailwind documnet "https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" and search it accordingly and start working on it.
